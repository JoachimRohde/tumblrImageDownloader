tumblrImageDownloader
=====================

Intro
------------
This little program downloads all the images of tumblr page. 

Since I needed this only once for myself the code is quite hacky and dirty. But 
since it done it's job, I guess it might be also useful to someone else.


How to use it
-------------

```
java -jar tumblrImageDownloader [sitename...] [options...]
```

You can specify more than one site. Either you provide a full URL like e.g.
http://spongebob-closeups.tumblr.com/ or just the name of the tumblr site (spongebob-closeups).

Available options are:
- -p[path]        Specify download directory
- -ds             don't stop downloading a site after the first image was found which has been already downloaded 
- -u              Check for updates. This option will search for subdirectories in the destination directory and use the subdirectory-name as the name of the tumblr-page.

If you are not providing any download directory, images will be saved in: [home-directory]/tumblrImages/
For each specified sitename a subdirectory is created into which the images are downloaded.

What's missing / Known quirks
-----------------------------
- The program does not distinguish between different dimensions of an image, if several are provided, rather downloads them all.
- You cannot pass a parameter to start with page x
- No filtering (for e.g. filesize, dimension, format, etc.)
- The code is a mess. Really. Every time an exception occurred I just surrounded the line with a try-catch. 
  The "parsing" of the HTML... well... it's messy. Do not expect this program to work if tumblr decides to change anything in their HTML.
- Way too much debugging output.
